> In the past week (2020.07.05), I suspended the development of AT-UI-Library. And I discussed this project with my leader. For some legal reasons. I need to confirm that I have the right to release an open source project during my tenure. Thanks to my leader and my employer. I got a positive reply. I will restart the development work later. I hope I can use 1 hour non-working time every day to develop and improve this project.
